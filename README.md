## Data Access  

All site-frequency information and derived summary statistics will be made publicly available from this project to the extent permissible by sample consent and data use agreements. At this time, no public data is yet available, and we do not anticipate any public data becoming available prior to 2026.  

All sample-level data is stored in a secure Google Cloud bucket. Note that permissions must be granted for bucket access, and permissions cannot be granted to any users outside of those explicitly covered by the numerous data use agreements between DFCI/Van Allen lab and other organization.
